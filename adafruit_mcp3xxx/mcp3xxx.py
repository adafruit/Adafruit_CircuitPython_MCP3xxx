CircuitPython Library for MCP3xxx ADCs with SPI

* Author(s): ladyada, Brent Rubell

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* Adafruit `MCP3008 8-Channel 10-Bit ADC with SPI
  <https://www.adafruit.com/product/856>`_ (Product ID: 856)

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the supported boards:
  https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases
* Adafruit's Bus Device library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice

.. note:: The ADC chips' input pins (AKA "channels") are aliased in this library
    as integer variables whose names start with "P" (eg ``MCP3008.P0`` is channel 0 on the MCP3008
    chip). Each module that contains a driver class for a particular ADC chip has these aliases
    predefined accordingly. This is done for code readability and prevention of erroneous SPI
    commands.

.. important::
    The differential reads (comparisons done by the ADC chip) are limited to certain pairs of
    channels. These predefined pairs are referenced in this documentation as differential
    channel mappings. Please refer to the driver class of your ADC chip (`MCP3008`_,
    `MCP3004`_, `MCP3002`_) for a list of available differential channel mappings.
